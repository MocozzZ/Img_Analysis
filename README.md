# img_analysis

Some very simple code for image processing.

Three copies of the code have been updated

# Requirements
  numpy == 1.20.3
  
  opencv-python == 4.5.5.64
  
  pillow == 8.4.0
  
They are all common Python libraries.So I don't recommend you install them by 'requirements.txt'.I recommend that you install the latest version by 'pip install xxx'
