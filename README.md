# Img_Analysis

Some very simple code for image processing.

These are the codes that I need to write down as I finish my project.

Some codes cannot be uploaded for some reason.

Three copies of the code have been updated.

# Requirements
  numpy == 1.20.3
  
  opencv-python == 4.5.5.64
  
  pillow == 8.4.0
  
They are all common Python libraries.So I don't recommend you install them by 'requirements.txt'.I recommend that you install the latest version by 'pip install xxx'

# Version 1.1
